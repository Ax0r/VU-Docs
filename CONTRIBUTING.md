# Contribution Guidelines

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the VU documentation. Even though the guidelines below are not strict rules, failing to adhere to them might result in the rejection of your contribution in some cases, so please take a few minutes to read through them.

## How to contribute

### Reporting documentation issues

The easiest way to contribute is by reporting issues with the current documentation. Those reports can then be picked up by other contributors and can be used to improve the overall quality of the documentation. Keep in mind that this repository is only for tracking issues with the documentation, and not for anything else like VU itself.

Before reporting an issue, please make sure that it has not already been reported by another contributor by searching through the [open issues]([/issues](https://github.com/EmulatorNexus/VU-Docs/issues)) list and that it is relevant to the latest version of the documentation that's currently available at [https://docs.veniceunleashed.net](https://docs.veniceunleashed.net).

Once you are certain that your issue is unique and relevant you can report it by [creating a new issue](https://github.com/EmulatorNexus/VU-Docs/issues/new) and describing it in detail. In order for other contributors to be able to efficiently process your issue please make sure to use a **clear and descriptive title**, mention the **exact page (or pages) where the issue is found**, and describe **where in that page the issue is** and **what you were expecting the correct content to be**.

After you've submitted your issue, be patient. A contributor will look at it when their time allows it and process it accordingly. Make sure to keep an eye on it, as they might have further questions for you or require clarification.

### Sending pull requests

You can contribute to the documentation more directly by making changes to it yourself and then sending them back to this repository in the form of a pull request. For more information about pull requests and how to create one you can refer to the official [Github article](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-requests) on them. You can also refer to the main [README](/README.md) file for information on how to develop the documentation locally.

As with issues, we expect contributors sending pull requests to describe their changes and the intent behind them clearly and in detail. Additionally, we request that contributors respect the following style guide for their git commits:

- Use the present tense and the imperative mood in commit messages ("Add missing field..." not "Adds missing field...")
- Limit the first line of the commit message to 72 characters or less
- Keep commits discrete and focused on a specific set of changes, or even individual files
- Explain the reasoning behind changes (where appropriate) after the first line of the commit message
